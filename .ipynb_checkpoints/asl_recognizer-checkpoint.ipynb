    "The overall goal of this project is to build a word recognizer for American Sign Language video sequences, demonstrating the power of probabalistic models.  In particular, this project employs  [hidden Markov models (HMM's)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model) to analyze a series of measurements taken from videos of American Sign Language (ASL) collected for research (see the [RWTH-BOSTON-104 Database](http://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/~dreuw/database-rwth-boston-104.php)).  In this video, the right-hand x and y locations are plotted as the speaker signs the sentence.\n",

You will derive a variety of feature sets (explored in Part 1), as well as implement three different model selection criterion to determine the optimal number of hidden states for each word model (explored in Part 2). Finally, in Part 3 you will implement the recognizer and compare the effects the different combinations of feature sets and model selection criteria.  \n",

For example, we could normalize each speaker's range of motion with grouped statistics using [Pandas stats](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/api.html#api-dataframe-stats) functions and [pandas groupby](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.groupby.html).

As a simple starting example, we train a single word using Gaussian hidden Markov models (HMM).   By using the `fit` method during training, the [Baum-Welch Expectation-Maximization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baum%E2%80%93Welch_algorithm) (EM) algorithm is invoked iteratively to find the best estimate for the model *for the number of hidden states specified* from a group of sample seequences. For this example, we *assume* the correct number of hidden states is 3, but that is just a guess.  How do we know what the \"best\" number of states for training is?  We will need to find some model selection technique to choose the best parameter."

    "##### Cross-validation folds\n",
    "If we simply score the model with the Log Likelihood calculated from the feature sequences it has been trained on, we should expect that more complex models will have higher likelihoods. However, that doesn't tell us which would have a better likelihood score on unseen data.  The model will likely be overfit as complexity is added.  To estimate which topology model is better using only the training data, we can compare scores using cross-validation.  One technique for cross-validation is to break the training set into \"folds\" and rotate which fold is left out of training.  The \"left out\" fold scored.  This gives us a proxy method of finding the best model to use on \"unseen data\". In the following example, a set of word sequences is broken into three folds using the [scikit-learn Kfold](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.KFold.html) class object. When you implement `SelectorCV`, you will use this technique."

    "##### Scoring models with other criterion\n",
    "Scoring model topologies with **BIC** balances fit and complexity within the training set for each word.  In the BIC equation, a penalty term penalizes complexity to avoid overfitting, so that it is not necessary to also use cross-validation in the selection process.  There are a number of references on the internet for this criterion.  These [slides](http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/courses/02433/doc/ch6_slides.pdf) include a formula you may find helpful for your implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages of scoring model topologies with **DIC** over BIC are presented by Alain Biem in this [reference](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.58.6208&rep=rep1&type=pdf) (also found [here](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ed3d/7c4a5f607201f3848d4c02dd9ba17c791fc2.pdf)).  DIC scores the discriminant ability of a training set for one word against competing words.  Instead of a penalty term for complexity, it provides a penalty if model liklihoods for non-matching words are too similar to model likelihoods for the correct word in the word set."

    "**Answer 2:** BIC tries to penalize complexity. Models using BIC seems to have lesser states as compared to DIC. DIC on the other hand tries to discriminate the word on which the model is being trained on v/s the other words as much as possible. Predicitive accuracy of the model selected using DIC should be higher. Models built and selected using CV should provide similar performance on an unknown data set as compared to the training set on which it was modeled. This is because the model performance in CV is on multiple small test sets from the training sample. The models selected using BIC and DIC can't be expected to have similar performance on an unknown data set as the training set. That's because the model performance in the cases of BIC and DIC are on the training set."

    "**Question 3:**  Summarize the error results from three combinations of features and model selectors.  What was the \"best\" combination and why?  What additional information might we use to improve our WER?  For more insight on improving WER, take a look at the introduction to Part 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer 3:** I first chose the constant selector and the 4 ground features. The model wasn't doing well with 0.6685 WER. I then chose a DIC Selector with the same 4 ground features and I got a slightly better performing model. The WER was 0.5674. Models selected using DIC can discrimate better. For the last attempt, I tried adding more features but then use BIC to penalize a lot of complexity in terms of states. The features used were the 4 ground features, normalized positions of the left and right hands as well as polar features. The WER turned out to be the best with value 0.4719. By adding more features but then compensating for over-fitting by using BIC, I was able to get the best model so far. "

    "## PART 4: (OPTIONAL)  Improve the WER with Language Models\n",
    "We've squeezed just about as much as we can out of the model and still only get about 50% of the words right! Surely we can do better than that.  Probability to the rescue again in the form of [statistical language models (SLM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model).  The basic idea is that each word has some probability of occurrence within the set, and some probability that it is adjacent to specific other words. We can use that additional information to make better choices.\n",

Improve the WER with the SLM data provided with the data set in the link above using \"1-gram\", \"2-gram\", and/or \"3-gram\" statistics. The `probabilities` data you've already calculated will be useful and can be turned into a pandas DataFrame if desired (see next cell).  \n",
